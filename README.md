# covid19trackerapp
The webpage is being tested here: https://jordangregson.github.io/covid19trackerapp/

This my first try and attempt at using APIs within Javascript. I liked it when the weather channel has the COVID-19 data on their app, and now that it is gone, I thought that I might be able to make my own COVID-19 tracker website. My goal for this website is to show basic information about COVID-19, and display it in a neat way
